## Qwiic Assembly

Assembling these breakouts into a Qwiic circuit is as simple as plugging the board into your chosen microcontroller with a Qwiic cable. After assembling your circuit, it should look similar to the photos below:

## Soldered Assembly

Users who prefer a soldered connection or wish to use the SYNC and READY/INT pins should solder to the board for permanent connections.
